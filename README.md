# Steeped
A non-linear ambient web experience. Lo-fi interaction, high-saturation mood.
Steeped is a non-linear ambient web experience built to evoke mood through subtle interaction, sound, and atmosphere. It’s not a game—there are no goals, scores, or progression. Instead, it invites users to linger in a quiet digital space where tea, memory, and time blur. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, Steeped explores interactive storytelling without narration, using visual cues, texture, and poetic fragments to create a sense of presence and stillness.
